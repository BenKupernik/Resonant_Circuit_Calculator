# Resonant_Circuit_Calculator
Calculates the electrical variables of a circuit

Another fun python project, this program is calculating the electrical variables of a circuit. It takes the resonant frequency bandwidth and gain of a circuit and ask if it is in series or parallel. It then calculates the resistance inductance and capacitance and displays all 6 values to the user. There is one superclass called ResonantCircuit which collects the resonant frequency bandwidth and gain, and has a display function that prints that information. There are also two subclasses called SeriesResonantCircuit and ParallelResonantCircuit that calculate the resistance inductance and capacitance depending on which type of circuit it is.
